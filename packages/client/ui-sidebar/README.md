## Summary

The sidebar shows the research library heading, returns to the global Agent through the expanded brand, collapses navigation to a 56px rail, and keeps Settings at the bottom. Topic and paper navigation belongs to the `sidebar.workspaces` occupant. Deployments can replace the brand mark and name while retaining the surrounding navigation controls. Idle scrollbars stay hidden without moving browser rows.

## Use this package

The sidebar is the navigation shell: users see the brand, start new sessions, collapse the rail, and reach Settings. Feature plugins fill its seats — ui-workspace fills `sidebar.workspaces`, ui-settings registers the trigger row and settings panel at `sidebar.settings`.

### Brand and New Session

GraphResearch hides the dedicated New Session control and the Plugins and Automation tasks navigation rows. This also applies to the collapsed rail and the macOS header, leaving the research library, collapse control and Settings visible.

The expanded brand renders `sidebar.brand.mark` and `sidebar.brand.name` as independent single slots; collapsing hides the brand and its global Agent return action. Clicking the brand opens the global Agent through the research navigation owner rather than creating a conversation. The separate panel icon expands or collapses the sidebar. Without occupants, the shell uses the fish mark and localized **Research library** title, with no build version or commit badge. The compact title row sits directly above the research directory controls. The [research workspace](../ui-workspace/README.md) owns conversation restoration and creation.

### Global panel entries

Plugins add an icon component to the root-scoped `sidebar.panellist` list with an `id`, optional `order`, and a string or locale-aware `label`. The same id addresses the component registered in the layout's root-scoped `main` keyed slot; selecting a missing main entry throws without changing the current selection. The label supplies plain visible text, the accessible name, and the collapsed tooltip. Each row reads its own selected state through `usePanelInfo`; moving DOM focus to search or a directory picker does not change the displayed panel or its selected row. With no registrations, neither the list nor spacing for it is rendered. The shipped composition registers no example panel.

### Collapse behavior

The sidebar and conversation-header toggles show the effective shortcut from the command catalog in their hover and keyboard-focus tooltips and `aria-keyshortcuts`. An unbound command shows only the action label.

The top expand button hosts the optional, non-interactive `sidebar.toggle.badge` slot while collapsed. Its occupant supplies status and tooltip content without adding another action or changing the button's navigation behavior.

During a live collapse, the expanded content fades out at its current width, the upper controls share one fade and leftward translation into the 56px rail, and the layout's column slide ends the motion. A page that starts collapsed renders the rail statically, and reduced-motion mode disables both transitions. The bottom-pinned `sidebar.settings` control shares the fade timing but has no horizontal translation.

On Windows Electron, `html[data-windows-titlebar]` fixes the sidebar toggle in the caption’s top-left corner. When collapsed, the global Agent logo and sidebar content stay hidden while the toggle remains available. Caption controls stay outside the window drag region, and their tooltips open below the caption. The sidebar reserves `--dsh-windows-menu-start: 84px` to retain the caption menu clearance.

### macOS desktop

Under `html[data-platform='darwin']`, the expanded column’s 52px top strip clears the traffic lights and carries the collapse toggle. The strip and unoccupied logo-row area remain window drag regions; the brand button excludes its own clickable area and returns to the global Agent. Collapsing hides the column entirely. `HeaderLeadingControls` then exposes only the sidebar opener through the frame’s `shell.leading` seat beside the traffic lights; the global Agent logo stays hidden. The [Desktop reference](../../../apps/desktop/README.md) owns window integration.

### Scrollbars

Scrollbars in the column are a pointer affordance: the shell rebinds the scrollbar indirection to `transparent` whenever the pointer is outside the column and keeps the thumb drawn for 2s after the pointer leaves, so a list nobody is pointing at carries no bar. The reservation that keeps rows from moving belongs to the scrolling region (ui-workspace), so revealing a thumb never reflows.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The shell is pure composition: `SidebarRootComponentProps` composes the layout owner share, the global `useSessions` and `useWorkspaces` hooks, the declared brand, the `sidebar.workspaces` and `sidebar.settings` child slots, and injected navigation callbacks. Panel entries and their optional titles use the same composition path. Panel metadata is derived from list registrations and locale changes; selection belongs to the layout store.

### Slot discipline

Declaration-aware `slots.inject()` lets a replacing package activate before or after the sidebar. The foot is the `sidebar.settings` seat: the sidebar renders only the bottom-pinned layout slot and shares its column state (`wide`). The `/client` exports are the plugin body (`apply`/`inject`) plus the contract types only; SidebarRoot, the row components, and the tree derivation remain package-internal behind the slot registration.

## Further Exploration

These pages cover the surfaces that fill the shell's seats and the composition model.

- [ui-workspace](../ui-workspace/README.md) — the Workspace and Session browser rendered into `sidebar.workspaces`.
- [ui-settings](../ui-settings/README.md) — the settings domain base registering the trigger row at `sidebar.settings`.
- [ui-layout](../ui-layout/README.md) — the layout owner whose rail and column state the collapse uses.
- [ui-theme](../ui-theme/README.md) — the scrollbar token indirection the shell rebinds.
- [Slot system standard](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-22-slot-type-chain-implementation.md) — the composition model behind the seats.

## Model Experience

None, as the package is a browser-side UI plugin layer that registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define what the shell owns versus what its occupants own; they are current package constraints.

- **Session state-dot rendering is owned by ui-workspace** — no done/error notification sources are available to this shell.
- **Workspace browser behavior is composition-owned** — grouping, ordering, search, and row state belong to ui-workspace, not this shell.
- **"New task completed" unread marking is local viewing state** — completion-time > last-seen never reaches the host.
